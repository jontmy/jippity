#### What is Jippity?
Jippity is just a frontend made with Next.js for calling the OpenAI API for GPT-4 (and their other GPT models).

#### How do I use Jippity?
You'll need to bring your own OpenAI API key from [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
Jippity only stores your API key in your browser (never remotely!), and your API key will only be used to send your messages to GPT.

#### Why did I create this?
Cuz I'm too cheap to pay 20 USD per month just for access to GPT-4.
OpenAI's API lets you pay for your usage of GPT-4 and other models as you go, which ends up being significantly cheaper per month.
